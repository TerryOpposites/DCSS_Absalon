welcome

<white>Welcome to Dungeon Crawl!</white>

Your objective is to lead your <w>{{ return you.race() }} {{ return you.class()
}}</w> safely through the depths of the dungeon, retrieving the fabled Orb of
Zot and returning it to the surface. In the beginning, however, let discovery
be your main goal. Try to delve as deeply as possible but beware; death lurks
around every corner.

For the moment, just remember the following keys and their functions:
  <input>$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_COMMANDS]?</input> — shows the items and the commands
  <input>$cmd[CMD_SAVE_GAME]</input>  — saves the game, to be resumed later
(but note that death is permanent)
  <input>$cmd[CMD_LOOK_AROUND]</input>  — examines something in your vicinity

The hint mode will help you play Crawl without reading any documentation. If
you haven't yet, you might want to try out the tutorial. Also, if you feel
intrigued, there is more information available in the following files from the
docs/ directory (all of which can also be read in-game):
  <lightblue>quickstart.txt</lightblue>     — A very short guide to Crawl.
  <lightblue>crawl_manual.txt</lightblue>   — This contains all details on
species, magic, skills, etc.
  <lightblue>options_guide.txt</lightblue>  — Crawl's interface is highly
configurable. This document explains all the options.

Happy Crawling!
%%%%
death

Condolences! Your character's premature death is a sad, but common occurrence
in Crawl. Rest assured that with diligence and playing experience your
characters will last longer.

Perhaps the following advice can improve your playing style:
%%%%
death conjurer melee

As a Conjurer your main weapon should be offensive magic. Cast spells more
often! Remember to rest when your Magic is low.
%%%%
death berserker unberserked

Don't forget to go berserk when fighting particularly difficult foes. It's
risky, but makes you faster and beefier.
%%%%
death ranger melee

Your bow and arrows are extremely powerful against distant monsters. Be sure to
collect all arrows lying around in the dungeon.
%%%%
death random 0

Always consider using projectiles, wands or spells before engaging monsters in
close combat.
%%%%
death random 1

Learn when to run away from things you can't handle — this is important! It is
often wise to skip a particularly dangerous level. But don't overdo this as
monsters will only get harder the deeper you delve.
%%%%
death random 2

Rest between encounters, if possible in an area already explored and cleared of
monsters. Pressing <input>$cmd[CMD_REST]</input><localtiles>, or
<input>clicking on the 'rest' button in the command bar'</input></localtiles>
will rest for 100 turns, or until fully healed.
%%%%
death random 3

Remember to use those scrolls, potions or wands you've found. Learn to
improvise: you will need to identify potions and scrolls by using them.
%%%%
death random 4

If a particular encounter feels overwhelming, don't forget to use emergency
items early on. A scroll of teleportation or a potion of haste can really save
your bacon.
%%%%
death random 5

Never fight more than one monster, if you can help it. Always back into a
corridor so that they are forced to fight you one on one.
%%%%
finished

Congrats! You survived until the end of hints mode — be sure to try the
other characters as well. Note that the command help screen
(<input>$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_COMMANDS]?</input>) will look very different from now
on. Here's a last playing hint:
%%%%
finished explored

Walking around and exploring levels gets easier by using auto-explore
(<input>$cmd[CMD_EXPLORE]</input>). Crawl will let you automatically move to
and pick up interesting items.<localtiles>

Autoexploration can also be started by <input>Ctrl-Leftclick</input> on the
minimap.</localtiles>
%%%%
finished travel

There is a convenient way to travel between distant dungeon levels: press
<input>$cmd[CMD_INTERLEVEL_TRAVEL]</input> and enter the desired destination.
If your travel gets interrupted, issuing <input>$cmd[CMD_INTERLEVEL_TRAVEL]
Enter</input> will continue it.
%%%%
finished stashes

You can search among all items existing in the dungeon with the
<input>$cmd[CMD_SEARCH_STASHES]</input> command. For example,
<input>$cmd[CMD_SEARCH_STASHES]</input> <w>“dagger”</w> will list all daggers,
and allow you to travel to them. You can even search for dungeon features, like
<w>“shop”</w> or <w>“altar”</w>.
%%%%
finished random 0

The game keeps an automated log for your characters. Use
<input>$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_COMMANDS]:</input> to read it. Once your character
perishes, two morgue files are left in the <w>morgue/</w> directory. The one
ending in .txt contains a copy of your log. During play, you can create a dump
file with <input>$cmd[CMD_CHARACTER_DUMP]</input>.
%%%%
finished random 1

Crawl has a macro function built in: press <input>$cmd[CMD_MACRO_MENU]</input>
to define a macro by first specifying a trigger key (say, <input>F1</input>)
and a command sequence, for example <input>za.</input>. The latter will make
the <input>F1</input> key always zap the spell in slot a at the nearest
monster. For more information on macros, type
<input>$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_COMMANDS]~</input>.
%%%%
finished random 2

The interface can be greatly customised. All options are explained in the file
<w>options_guide.txt</w> which can be found in the <w>docs</w> directory. The
options themselves are set in <w>init.txt</w> or <w>.crawlrc</w>. Crawl will
complain if it can't find either file.
%%%%
finished random 3

You can ask other Crawl players for advice and help using any of the community
resources described at http://crawl.develz.org/
%%%%
HINT_CONVERT Xom

You've just converted to worshipping <w>Xom</w>. As a follower of Xom, you'll
be treated like a plaything, randomly helped or harmed for Xom's own amusement.

There is no way to guarantee Xom remains in a good mood - the best any follower
can hope for is to avoid letting Xom grow bored!
%%%%
HINT_CONVERT Gozag

You've just converted to worshipping <w>Gozag</w>. Unlike other gods, Gozag only
cares about gold; each divine power costs gold, and your foes turn to gold on
death.
%%%%
HINT_CONVERT Ru

You've just converted to worshipping <w>Ru</w>. Unlike other gods, Ru grants
piety (divine favour) in exchange for permanent sacrifices, like giving up your
ability to drink potions while endangered, or losing the ability to train
certain skills. The more piety you have, the more abilities Ru will grant, and
the more powerful those abilities will become. Ru will offer more sacrifices as
you explore the depths of the dungeon.
%%%%
HINT_CONVERT Uskayaw

You've just converted to worshipping <w>Uskayaw</w>. Unlike other gods,
Uskayaw's favour cannot be gradually gained as you explore the dungeon or slay
monsters. Instead, piety with Uskayaw is gained rapidly in combat as you deal
damage. The longer you remain in combat and the more damage you deal, the
greater the powers you will be offered. Once combat ends, Uskayaw's favour will
be quickly lost, and must be regained in the next battle.
%%%%
HINT_CONVERT

You've just converted to worshipping <w>{{ return you.god() }}</w>. Your piety
(divine favour) will increase as you do things to please your new god, and will
gradually decrease over time.

You can check your god's likes and dislikes, as well as your current standing
and divine abilities, by typing
<input>$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_RELIGION]</input><localtiles>, or by pressing
<input>Shift-right-click</input> on your avatar</localtiles>.
%%%%
HINT_REST_BETWEEN_FIGHTS

Remember to rest between fights and to enter unexplored terrain with full health
and magic. Ideally you should retreat into areas you've already explored and
cleared of monsters; resting on the edge of the explored terrain increases the
chances of your rest being interrupted by wandering monsters. To rest, press
<w>5</w> or <w>Shift-numpad 5</w><tiles>, or <w>click the rest button</w>
</tiles>.

%%%%
HINT_BERSERK_CONSERVES_HP

Also, berserking might help you not to lose so much health in the first place.
To use your abilities press <w>a</w>.;

%%%%
HINT_SEEN_FIRST_OBJECT

That <console>$1 </console>is an item. If you move there and press
<input>$cmd[CMD_PICKUP]</input><localtiles>, or <input>left-click</input> on it
in your inventory</localtiles>, you will pick it up.<console> Generally, items
are shown by non-letter symbols like <w>%?!"=()[</w>.</console> Some
objects<tiles>, marked with a green frame,</tiles> will be picked up
automatically.

Once it is in your inventory, you can drop it again with <localtiles>a
<input>Shift-left-click</input>. Whenever you <input>right-click</input> on an
item</localtiles><console><input>$cmd[CMD_DROP]</input>. Any time you look at an
item in your inventory (<input>$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_INVENTORY]</input>)</console>,
you can read about its properties and its description.
%%%%
HINT_SEEN_POTION

You have picked up your first potion<console> ('<w>$item[potion]</w>')</console>.
<localtiles>Simply <w>left-click</w> on it, or press</localtiles>
<nomouse>Press</nomouse> <w>$cmd[CMD_QUAFF]</w> to quaff it.

Once you've identified a potion, either with a scroll of identification or by
drinking it, you'll automatically recognize all other potions of the same type;
this means it's sometimes useful to drink potions just to identify them.
%%%%
HINT_SEEN_SCROLL

You have picked up your first scroll<console> ('<w>$item[scroll]</w>')</console>.
<localtiles>Simply <w>left-click</w> on it, or press</localtiles>
<nomouse>Press</nomouse> <w>$cmd[CMD_READ]</w> to read it.

Once you've identified a scroll, either with a scroll of identification or by
reading it, you'll automatically recognize all other scrolls of the same type;
this means it's sometimes useful to read scrolls just to identify them.
%%%%
HINT_SEEN_WAND

You have picked up your first wand<console> ('<w>$item[wand]</w>')</console>.
<localtiles>Simply <w>left-click</w> on it, or press</localtiles>
<nomouse>Press</nomouse> <w>$cmd[CMD_EVOKE]</w> to evoke it.

If you find more wands of the same type, they'll merge into this wand and add
charges to it.
%%%%
HINT_SEEN_SPBOOK

You have picked up a book<console> ('<w>$item[book]</w>')</console>. On pickup,
its spells are immediately added to your library. You'll be able to memorise
spells from it via <w>$cmd[CMD_MEMORISE_SPELL]</w>, and cast them with
<w>$cmd[CMD_CAST_SPELL]</w>.
{{
    if you.god() == "Trog" then
        return "Trog hates it when you memorise or study magic, though!"
    end
}}
%%%%
HINT_SEEN_WEAPON

This is the first weapon<console> ('<w>$item[weapon]</w>')</console> you've
picked up. Use <w>$cmd[CMD_WIELD_WEAPON]</w><localtiles> or
<w>left-click</w> on it</localtiles> to wield it, but be aware that this
weapon might train a different skill from your current one. You can view the
weapon's properties from your
<w>$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_INVENTORY]</w>nventory<localtiles> or by
<w>right-clicking</w> on it</localtiles>.

{{

               .. " enchantments can be worthwhile, though!"
    end
}}
%%%%
HINT_SEEN_MISSILES

This is the first stack of missiles<console> ('<w>$item[missile]</w>')</console>
you've picked up. Missiles like boomerangs and throwing nets can be thrown by
hand, but other missiles like arrows and bolts require a launcher and training
in using it to be really effective.
<localtiles><w>Right-click</w> on</localtiles><nomouse>Select</nomouse>
the item in your <w>$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_INVENTORY]</w>nventory to see more
information about both missiles and launcher.

               .." collecting arrows."
    elseif crawl.hints_type() = "magic" then
        return "However, as a spellslinger, you don't really need another type"
               .. " of ranged attack."

               .. " attacks."
    else
        return "";
    end
}}
%%%%
HINT_SEEN_ARMOUR

This is the first piece of armour<console> ('<w>$item[armour]</w>')</console>
you've picked up. <localtiles>You can click on it to wear it, and click again
to remove it. <w>Right-clicking</w> on it will give more information.
</localtiles><nomouse>Use <w>$cmd[CMD_WEAR_ARMOUR]</w> to wear it and

               .. " a list of your mutations and innate abilities.)"
    end
}}
%%%%
HINT_SEEN_RANDART

Weapons and armour that have unusual descriptions like this are much more likely
to be of higher enchantment or have special properties, good or bad.
%%%%
HINT_SEEN_CARRION

That<console> <w>$item[corpse]</w></console> is a corpse.
%%%%
HINT_NON_FLOOR_CARRION

Ah, a corpse!
%%%%
HINT_SEEN_JEWELLERY

You have picked up a piece of jewellery, either a ring
<console>('<w>$item[jewellery]</w>') </console>or an
amulet<console> ('<w>$item[amulet]</w>')</console>.
<nomouse>Press <w>$cmd[CMD_WEAR_JEWELLERY]</w> to put it on and
<w>$cmd[CMD_REMOVE_JEWELLERY]</w> to remove it. You can view its properties
from your <w>$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_INVENTORY]</w>nventory.</nomouse>
<localtiles>You can click on it to put it on, and click again to remove it. By
<w>right-clicking</w> on it, you can view its properties.</localtiles>
%%%%
HINT_SEEN_MISC

This is a curious object indeed. You can play around with it to find out what
it does by <localtiles>clicking on it to e<w>$cmd[CMD_EVOKE]</w>oke </localtiles>
<nomouse>e<w>$cmd[CMD_EVOKE]</w>oking </nomouse>it. As usual, selecting it from
your <w>$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_INVENTORY]</w>nventory might give you more information.
%%%%
HINT_SEEN_STAFF

You have picked up a magic staff<console> ('<w>$item[magical staff]</w>')</console>.
It must be <w>$cmd[CMD_WIELD_WEAPON]</w>ielded to be of use. Magicians use
staves to increase their power in certain spell schools. It can also be used as
a weapon.<localtiles> You can wield a staff by <w>left-clicking</w>.</localtiles>
%%%%
HINT_SEEN_GOLD

You have picked up your first pile of gold<console>
('<yellow>$item[gold]</yellow>')</console>. Unlike most other objects in Crawl
it takes up no space in your inventory and can't be dropped. Gold can be used to
buy items from shops, and is appreciated by certain gods.
%%%%
HINT_SEEN_STAIRS

These<console> '$1'</console> are downstairs. You can enter the next (deeper)
level by following them down (<w>$cmd[CMD_GO_DOWNSTAIRS]</w>). To return to this
level, press <w>$cmd[CMD_GO_UPSTAIRS]</w> while standing on the upstairs.
<localtiles>Alternatively, you can <w>left-click</w> on stairs you're standing
on to use them.</localtiles>
%%%%
HINT_SEEN_ESCAPE_HATCH

This<console> '$1'</console> is an escape hatch. You can use it to leave a
level with <w>$cmd[CMD_GO_UPSTAIRS]</w> and <w>$cmd[CMD_GO_DOWNSTAIRS]</w>
respectively<localtiles> (or by <w>left-clicking</w>)</localtiles>, like stairs;
unlike stairs, however, hatches are a one-way trip, so be careful when
descending!
%%%%
HINT_SEEN_BRANCH

This<console> '$1'</console> is the entrance to a different branch of the
dungeon, which might have different terrain, level layout and monsters from the
current main branch you're in. Some branches contain only a single level, and
others are many levels deep. They can also contain entrances to other branches.

The first three branches you'll encounter are the Temple, the Lair and the
Orcish Mines. While the Lair and the Mines can be dangerous for the new
adventurer, the Temple is completely safe and contains a number of altars at
which you might convert to a new god.
%%%%
HINT_SEEN_PORTAL

This<console> '$1'</console> is a portal to an optional level, offering extra
loot in exchange for extra danger. There's no penalty for skipping it, but the
portal will disappear if you wait, so you have to decide now if you want to risk
it.
%%%%
HINT_SEEN_BAZAAR_PORTAL

This<console> '$1'</console> is a portal to an inter-dimensional bazaar filled
with shops. It will disappear if you don't enter it soon, so hurry.
%%%%
HINT_SEEN_PORTAL_2

You can enter a portal just like a set of stairs, by standing on it and
<localtiles><w>clicking</w> or </localtiles>pressing
<w>$cmd[CMD_GO_DOWNSTAIRS]</w>. To return, find <tiles>a similar looking portal.
</tiles><console>another $1 - but NOT the ancient stone arch you'll start out
on!</console>
%%%%
HINT_STAIR_BRAND

<tiles>A small symbol on a stair tile signifies that there are items in that
position that you may want to check out.</tiles>
<console>If any items are covering stairs or an escape hatch, then that will
be indicated by highlighting the <w><<</w> or <w>></w> symbol, instead of hiding
the stair symbol with an item glyph.</console>
%%%%
HINT_HEAP_BRAND

<tiles>A small symbol on an item tile signifies that there is at least one other
item in the same heap that you may want to check out.</tiles>
<console>If two or more items are on a single square, then the square will be
highlighted, and the symbol for the item on the top of the heap will be shown.
</console>
%%%%
HINT_TRAP_BRAND

<console>If any items are covering a trap, then that will be indicated by
highlighting the <w>^</w> symbol, instead of hiding the trap symbol with an item
glyph.</console>
%%%%
HINT_SEEN_TRAP

You just discovered a trap. You'll occasionally stumble into these nasty
constructions<console>, depicted by $1</console>. Each type of trap has a
different effect when stepped on, like alerting enemies or causing random
teleportation.
%%%%
HINT_TRIGGERED_TRAP

Oops... you just triggered a trap. You'll occasionally stumble into these nasty
constructions<console>, depicted by $1</console>. Each type of trap has a
different effect when stepped on, like alerting enemies or causing random
teleportation.
%%%%
HINT_SEEN_ALTAR

That<console> $1</console> is an altar.
<localtiles>By <w>right-clicking</w> on it with your mouse</localtiles>
<nomouse>If you target the altar with <w>$cmd[CMD_LOOK_AROUND]</w>, then press
<w>$cmd[CMD_TARGET_DESCRIBE]</w></nomouse> you can get a short description.

Press <w>$cmd[CMD_GO_UPSTAIRS]</w> or <w>$cmd[CMD_GO_DOWNSTAIRS]</w> while
standing on the square to join the faith or read some information about the god
in question. Before taking up the corresponding faith you'll be asked for
confirmation.

{{
    if you.god() == "No God" and crawl.hints_type() = "magic" then
        return "The simplest god for an inexperienced conjurer is probably"
               .. " Vehumet, though Sif Muna is a good second choice."
    end
}}
%%%%
HINT_SEEN_SHOP

That<console> $1</console> is a shop. You can enter it by typing
<w>$cmd[CMD_GO_UPSTAIRS]</w> or <w>$cmd[CMD_GO_DOWNSTAIRS]</w>
<tiles>, or by <w>left-clicking</w> on it<tiles>
while standing on the square.

If there's anything you want which you can't afford yet, you can hold
<w>Shift</w> and press the corresponding letter to put it on your shopping list.
The game will then remind you when you gather enough gold to buy it.
%%%%
HINT_SEEN_DOOR

That<console> $1</console> is a closed door. You can open it by walking into it.
Sometimes it is useful to close a door. Do so by <nomouse>pressing
<w>$cmd[CMD_CLOSE_DOOR]</w> while next to it. If there are several doors, you
will then be prompted for a direction.</nomouse><localtiles>clicking on the door
while next to it.</localtiles>
%%%%
HINT_SEEN_RUNED_DOOR

That<console> $1</console> is a runed door, which is probably in front of
something unusually dangerous. Monsters will never open it. If you do, the runes
will be broken, and it will become a normal door.
%%%%
HINT_KILLED_MONSTER

Congratulations, your character just gained experience by killing this monster!
This will raise some of your skills, making you more deadly.
{{
    if you.god() == "Trog" then
        return "Also, most kills will grant you favour in the eyes of Trog."
    end
}}
%%%%
HINT_NEW_LEVEL

Well done! Reaching a new experience level is always a nice event: you get more
health and magic points, and occasionally increases to your attributes:
strength, intelligence, and dexterity.

{{
    if crawl.hints_type() == "magic" then
        return "Gaining an experience level also lets you learn more difficult"
               .. " spells. You can memorise a second spell with"
               .. " <w>$cmd[CMD_MEMORISE_SPELL]</w><tiles> or by"
               .. " <w>clicking</w> on it in the memorisation tab</tiles>."
    end
}}
%%%%
HINT_SKILL_RAISE

One of your skills just reached a milestone. The skills you use are
automatically trained whenever you gain experience, by killing monsters. By
default, experience goes to skills you actively use. To view or manage your
skills, type <w>$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_SKILLS]</w><localtiles> or click on the skill
tab in the bottom-right</localtiles>.
%%%%
HINT_GAINED_MAGICAL_SKILL

Being skilled in a magical "school" makes it easier to learn and cast spells of
that school. Many spells belong to a combination of several schools, in which
case the average skill in these schools will determine spellcasting success and
power.
%%%%
HINT_GAINED_MELEE_SKILL

Being skilled with a particular type of weapon will make you deal slightly more
damage and attack significantly faster with all weapons of that type. It's a
good idea to focus on just one weapon type, usually one you start with, though
finding a particularly good weapon may justify a switch.
%%%%
HINT_GAINED_RANGED_SKILL

Being skilled in a particular type of ranged attack will let you deal more
damage when using the appropriate weapons. It is usually best to concentrate on
one type of ranged attack (including spells), and to use a melee weapon as a
backup for fighting weak enemies.
%%%%
HINT_CHOOSE_STAT

Every third level, you get to choose an attribute to raise: strength,
intelligence, or dexterity.

<w>Strength</w> makes heavy armour less cumbersome and slightly increases weapon damage.

<w>Intelligence</w> makes your spells more reliable and powerful.

<w>Dexterity</w> increases your evasion and stealth.
%%%%
HINT_YOU_ENCHANTED

Enchantments of all types can befall you temporarily.
Brief descriptions of these appear at the lower end of the stats area.
Press <w>$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_CHARACTER_STATUS]</w> for more details. You can search
for full enchantment descriptions by pressing <w>$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_COMMANDS]/T</w>.
%%%%
HINT_YOU_POISON

Poison will rapidly reduce your health. You can wait it out with
<w>$cmd[CMD_REST]</w>, but if you're in combat or lethally poisoned, you'll
probably want to quaff a potion of curing.
%%%%
HINT_MULTI_PICKUP

There are a lot of items here. You choose what to pick up from a menu:
press <w>$cmd[CMD_PICKUP]</w><localtiles> or <w>click</w> on the player
doll</localtiles> to enter the pickup menu. To leave the menu, confirm your
selection with <w>Enter</w>.
%%%%
HINT_FULL_INVENTORY

Sadly, your inventory is limited to 52 items, and it appears your knapsack is
full. However, this is easy enough to rectify: simply <w>$cmd[CMD_DROP]</w>rop
some of the stuff you don't need right now. In the drop menu you can then
comfortably select which items to drop by pressing their inventory
letter<localtiles>, or by clicking on them</localtiles>.
%%%%
HINT_SHIFT_RUN

Walking around takes fewer keystrokes if you press <w>Shift-direction</w> or
<w>/ direction</w>. That will let you run until a monster comes into sight or
your character sees something interesting.
%%%%
HINT_MAP_VIEW

As you explore a level, orientation can become difficult. Press
<w>$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_MAP]</w> to bring up the level map. Typing <w>?</w> shows
the list of level map commands. Most importantly, moving the cursor to a spot
and pressing <w>.</w> or <w>Enter</w> lets your character move there on its own.

<localtiles>Also, clicking on the right-side minimap with your <w>right mouse
button</w> will zoom into that dungeon area. Clicking with the <w>left mouse
button</w> instead will let you move there.</localtiles>
%%%%
HINT_AUTO_EXPLORE

Fully exploring a level and picking up all the interesting looking items can be
tedious. To save on this tedium you can press <w>$cmd[CMD_EXPLORE]</w> to
auto-explore, which will automatically explore unmapped regions, automatically
pick up interesting items, and stop if a monster or interesting dungeon feature
(stairs, altar, etc.) is encountered.
%%%%
HINT_DONE_EXPLORE

Hey, you've finished exploring the dungeon on this level! You can search for
stairs from the level map (<w>$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_MAP]</w>) by pressing <w>></w>.
The cursor will jump to the nearest staircase, and by pressing <w>.</w> or
<w>Enter</w> your character can move there, too. Each level of Crawl has three
<console>white </console>up and three <console>white </console>down stairs.
Unexplored parts can often be accessed via another level.
%%%%
HINT_AUTO_EXCLUSION

To prevent autotravel or autoexplore taking you into dangerous territory, you
can set travel exclusions by entering the map view (<w>$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_MAP]</w>)
and then toggling the exclusion radius on the monster position with <w>e</w>.
To make this easier, some immobile monsters listed in the <w>auto_exclude</w>
option (such as this one) are considered dangerous enough to warrant an
automatic setting of an exclusion. It will be automatically cleared if you
manage to kill the monster. You could also manually remove the exclusion with
<w>$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_MAP]ee</w> but unless you remove this monster from the
auto_exclude list, the exclusion will be reset the next turn.
%%%%
HINT_HEALING_POTIONS

Your health is getting dangerously low. Retreating and/or quaffing a potion of
heal wounds or curing might be a good idea.
%%%%
HINT_NEED_HEALING

If you're low on health or magic and there's no urgent need to move, you can
rest for a bit. Ideally, you should retreat to an area you've already explored
and cleared of monsters before resting, since resting on the edge of the
explored terrain increases the risk of rest being interrupted by a wandering
monster. Press <w>$cmd[CMD_REST]</w> or <w>shift-numpad-5</w>
<localtiles>, or click on the 'rest' button,</localtiles> to do so.
%%%%
HINT_NEED_POISON_HEALING

You are lethally poisoned, so now would be a good time to
<w>$cmd[CMD_QUAFF]</w>uaff a potion of heal wounds or, better yet, a potion of
curing. If you have seen neither of these so far, try unknown potions in your
inventory. Good luck!
%%%%
HINT_INVISIBLE_DANGER

Fighting against a monster you cannot see is difficult. If you don't have a
source of see invisibility, you can find invisible monsters by luring them into
shallow water, opaque clouds (from a scroll of fog), or a corridor, where their
movements will be more predictable. If things go south, try teleporting out, or
leaving the level entirely!
%%%%
HINT_NEED_HEALING_INVIS

You recently noticed an invisible monster, so unless you killed it or left the
scene, resting might not be safe. If you still need to replenish your health or
magic, you'll have to quaff an appropriate potion. For normal resting you will
first have to get away from the danger.
%%%%
HINT_CAN_BERSERK

Against particularly difficult foes, you should use your Berserk
<w>$cmd[CMD_USE_ABILITY]</w>bility. Killing monsters while berserking makes it
last longer.
%%%%
HINT_POSTBERSERK

Berserking is extremely exhausting! Afterwards you are slowed down, and you
won't be able to berserk again until enough time passes for your exhaustion to
fade.
%%%%
HINT_RUN_AWAY_1

Whenever your health is very low and you're in danger of dying, check your
options carefully. Often, retreat or use of some item might be a viable
alternative to fighting on.
%%%%
HINT_LAST_MINUTE_BERSERK

With Trog's support, you can use your Berserk ability
(<w>$cmd[CMD_USE_ABILITY]</w>) to temporarily gain more health and greater
strength. Bear in mind that berserking at the last minute is often risky,
and prevents you from using items to escape!
%%%%
HINT_RUN_AWAY_2

If retreating to another level, keep in mind that monsters may follow you if
they're standing right next to you when you start climbing or descending the
stairs. And even if you've managed to shake them off, they'll still be there
when you come back, so you might want to use a different set of stairs when you
return.
%%%%
HINT_RETREAT_CASTER

Without magical power you're unable to cast spells. While melee is a
possibility, that's not where your strengths lie, so retreat (if possible) might
be the better option.
%%%%
HINT_ADVISE_USE_WAND

Or you could e<w>$cmd[CMD_EVOKE]</w>oke a wand to deal damage.
%%%%
HINT_YOU_MUTATED

Mutations can be obtained from several sources, among them potions, spell
miscasts, and overuse of strong enchantments like invisibility. The gods Zin
and Jiyva will cure your mutations. Check your mutations with
<w>$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_MUTATIONS]</w>.

Flight will allow you to cross deep water or lava. Items that allow you to fly

HINT_ITEM_RESISTANCES

Equipping this item affects your resistances. Check the overview screen

overview button</w> in the command panel</localtiles>) for details.
%%%%
HINT_GOD_DISPLEASED

Uh-oh, $1 is growing displeased because your piety is running low. Possibly this
is the case because you're committing heretical acts, because $1 finds your
worship lacking, or a combination of the two. If your piety goes to zero, then
you'll be excommunicated. Better get cracking on raising your piety, and/or stop
annoying your god. In any case, you'd better reread the religious description.
To do so, press <w>$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_RELIGION]</w><localtiles> or press
<w>Shift</w> and <w>right-click</w> on your avatar</localtiles>.
%%%%
HINT_EXCOMMUNICATED

Uh-oh, $1 just excommunicated you for running out of piety (your divine favour
went to nothing). Maybe you repeatedly violated the religious rules, or maybe
you failed to please your deity often enough, or some combination of the two.
If you can find an altar dedicated to $1, you can re-convert, and all will be
well. Otherwise you'll have to weather this god's displeasure until all divine
wrath is spent.
%%%%
HINT_GOD_ABANDONED

Should you decide that abandoning $1 wasn't such a smart move after all, and
you'd like to return to your old faith, you'll have to find an altar dedicated
to $1 where you can re-convert, and all will be well. Otherwise you'll have to
weather this god's displeasure until all divine wrath is spent.
%%%%
HINT_CONVERTED_GOD_NOT_ANGRY

Fortunately, it seems that $1 didn't mind your converting to $2.
%%%%
HINT_CONVERTED_GOD_ANGRY

Looks like $1 didn't appreciate your converting to $2.
%%%%
HINT_CONVERTED_KEPT_PIETY

You even kept some of your piety!
%%%%
HINT_CONVERTED_GOOD_TO_GOOD

Note that this kind of alliance only exists between the three good gods, so
don't expect this to be the norm.
%%%%
HINT_CONVERTED_GOOD_TO_NEUTRAL

That's because $1 is one of the good gods who generally are rather forgiving
about change of faith - unless you switch over to the path of evil, in which
case their retribution can be nasty indeed!
%%%%
HINT_CONVERTED_GOOD_TO_EVIL

But really, changing from one of the good gods to an evil one, what did you
expect!? For any god not on the opposing side of the faith, $1 would have been
much more forgiving.
%%%%
HINT_CONVERTED_NONGOOD_TO_HATED

(Actually,only the three good gods will usually be forgiving about this kind
of faithlessness.)
%%%%
HINT_CONVERTED_WRATH

Unfortunately, while converting back would appease $1, it would annoy $2, so
you're stuck with having to suffer the wrath of one god or another.
%%%%
HINT_SWITCH_WEAPONS_A_AND_B

You can easily switch between weapons in slots a and b by pressing
<w>$cmd[CMD_WEAPON_SWAP]</w>.
%%%%
HINT_SWITCH_BACK_TO_WEAPON_A

You can easily switch back to your weapon in slot a by
pressing <w>$cmd[CMD_WEAPON_SWAP]</w>. To change the slot of an item, press
<w>$cmd[CMD_ADJUST_INVENTORY]i</w> and choose the appropriate slots.
%%%%
HINT_SEEN_MONSTER_TILES

That monster is $1.
%%%%
HINT_SEEN_MONSTER_CONSOLE

$1 is a monster, usually depicted by a letter. Some typical early monsters look
like <brown>r</brown>, <green>l</green>, <brown>K</brown> or
<lightgrey>g</lightgrey>.
%%%%
HINT_MONSTER_LIST_CONSOLE

Your console settings allowing, you'll always see a list of monsters somewhere
on the screen.
%%%%
HINT_LEARN_ABOUT_MONSTERS

<tiles>You can learn about any monster by hovering your mouse over it, and read
its description by <w>right-clicking</w> on it.</tiles><nomouse>You can gain
information about it by pressing <w>$cmd[CMD_LOOK_AROUND]</w> and moving
the cursor over the monster, and read the monster description by then pressing
<w>$cmd[CMD_TARGET_DESCRIBE]</w>.</nomouse>

%%%%
HINT_ATTACK_MONSTER

To attack this monster with your wielded weapon, just move into it.
<tiles>Note that as long as there's a non-friendly monster in view you won't be
able to automatically move to distant squares, to avoid death by misclicking.
</tiles>
%%%%
HINT_ATTACK_MONSTER_RANGED

However, as a hunter you will want to deal with it using your bow. If you have
a look at your shortbow from your <w>i</w>nventory, you'll find an explanation
of how to do this.
%%%%
HINT_RANGED_NOT_WIELDED

First <w>w</w>ield it, then follow the instructions.<tiles>

As a short-cut you can also <w>right-click</w> on your shortbow to read its
description, and <w>left-click</w> to wield it.</tiles>
%%%%
HINT_RANGED_WIELDED

<tiles>Clicking with your <w>right mouse button</w> on your shortbow will also
let you read its description.</tiles>
%%%%
HINT_ATTACK_MONSTER_MAGIC

However, as a conjurer you will want to deal with it using magic. If you look at
the help entry for the <w>M</w>emorisation screen you'll find an explanation of
how to do this.
%%%%
HINT_FLEEING_MONSTER

Now that monster is scared of you! Note that you do not absolutely have to
follow it. Rather, you can let it run away. Sometimes, though, it can be useful
to attack a fleeing creature by throwing something after it. If you have any
stones in your <w>$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_INVENTORY]</w>nventory, you can look at one
of them to read an explanation of how to do this.
%%%%
HINT_MONSTER_BRAND

That monster looks a bit unusual. You might wish to examine it a bit more
closely by <localtiles>hovering your mouse over its tile.</localtiles>
<nomouse>pressing <w>$cmd[CMD_LOOK_AROUND]</w> and moving the cursor onto its
square.</nomouse>
%%%%
HINT_MONSTER_FRIENDLY

That monster is friendly to you and will attack your enemies, though you'll get
only part of the experience for monsters damaged by allies, compared to what
you'd get for doing all the work yourself. You can command your allies by
pressing <w>$cmd[CMD_SHOUT]</w>.
%%%%
HINT_TEMPORARILY_FRIENDLY

However, it is only <w>temporarily</w> friendly, and will become dangerous
again when this friendliness wears off.
%%%%
HINT_MONSTER_SHOUTED_UNSEEN

Uh-oh, some monster noticed you, either one that's around a corner or one that's
invisible. Plus, the noise it made will alert other monsters in the vicinity,
who will come to check out what the commotion was about.
%%%%
HINT_MONSTER_SHOUTED_SEEN

Uh-oh, that monster noticed you! Plus, the noise it made will alert other
monsters in the vicinity, who will come to check out what the commotion
was about.
%%%%
HINT_MONSTER_NO_SHOUT

Uh-oh, that monster noticed you! Fortunately, it didn't make any noise, but many
monsters do make noise when they notice you. That will alert other monsters in
the area, who will come to check out what the commotion was about.
%%%%
HINT_MONSTER_LEFT_LOS

$1 didn't vanish, but merely moved onto a square which you can't currently see.
It's still nearby, unless something happens to it in the short amount of time
it's out of sight.
%%%%
HINT_SEEN_ZERO_EXP_MON

That<console> $1</console> is $2. While <w>technically</w> a monster, it's
more like dungeon furniture, since it's harmless and doesn't move. If it's in
your way you can attack and kill it like other monsters, but you won't get any
experience for doing so.
%%%%
HINT_ABYSS

Uh-oh, you've wound up in the Abyss! The Abyss is a special place where you
cannot remember or map where you've been; it is filled with nasty monsters, and
you're probably going to die.

To increase your chances of survival until you can find the exit<console> (a
flickering <w>$1</w>)</console>, keep moving, don't fight any of the monsters,
and don't chase after items on the ground. If monsters are closing in, try to
use items of hasting to get away.
%%%%
HINT_SPELL_MISCAST_EFFECTS

Miscasting a spell can have nasty consequences, particularly for the more
difficult spells. Your chance of successfully casting a spell increases with
your magic skills, and can also be improved with the help of some items. Use
the <w>$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_SPELLS]</w> command<localtiles> or mouse over the spell
tiles</localtiles> to check your current failure rates.
%%%%
HINT_YOU_MISCAST

You just miscast a spell.
%%%%
HINT_MISCAST_ARMOUR

Wearing heavy body armour or using a shield, especially a large one, can
severely hamper your spellcasting abilities. You can check the effect of this
by comparing the failure rates on the <w>$cmd[CMD_CAST_SPELL]\?</w> screen with
and without the item being worn.
%%%%
HINT_MISCAST_CONTAMINATION_AND_MP

If the spellcasting success chance is high (which can be checked by entering
<w>$cmd[CMD_CAST_SPELL]\?</w> or <w>$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_SPELLS]</w>) then a miscast
merely means the spell is not working, along with a harmless side effect.
However, for spells with a high failure rate, there's a chance of contaminating
yourself with magical energy, plus a chance of an additional harmful side
effect. Normally this isn't a problem, since magical contamination bleeds off
over time, but if you're repeatedly contaminated in a short amount of time
you'll mutate or suffer from other ill side effects.

Note that a miscast spell will still consume the full amount of MP that a
successfully cast spell would.
%%%%
HINT_GLOWING

You've accumulated so much magical contamination that you're glowing! You
usually acquire magical contamination from using some powerful magics, like
invisibility, or from miscasting spells.

%%%%
HINT_CONTAMINATION_MILD

As long as the status only shows in grey nothing will actually happen as a
result of it, but as you continue suffusing yourself with magical contamination
you'll eventually start glowing for real, which can have nasty effects, such as
mutating you or dealing direct damage. In addition, glowing is going to make you
much more noticeable.
%%%%
HINT_CONTAMINATION_SEVERE

This normally isn't a problem as contamination slowly bleeds off on its own, but
it seems that you've accumulated so much contamination over a short amount of
time that it can have nasty effects, such as mutating you or dealing direct
damage. In addition, glowing is going to make you much more noticeable.
%%%%
HINT_YOU_RESIST

There are many dangers in Crawl. Luckily, there are ways to (at least partially)
resist some of them, if you are fortunate enough to find them. There are two
basic variants of resistances: the innate willpower that depends on your
species, grows with experience level, and protects against many magical effects;
and the specific resistances against certain other effects, e.g. fire or
draining.

You can find items in the dungeon or gain mutations that will increase (or
lower) one or more of your resistances. To view your current set of resistances,
<localtiles><w>right-click</w> on the player avatar, or </localtiles>press
<w>$cmd[CMD_RESISTS_SCREEN]</w>.
%%%%
HINT_CAUGHT_IN_NET

While you are held in a net, you cannot move around or engage monsters in
combat. Instead, any movement you take is counted as an attempt to struggle free
from the net.
{{
    if crawl.hints_type() == "magic" then
        return "Note that casting spells is still very much possible, as is"

               .. " possible."
    end
}}
%%%%
HINT_YOU_SILENCE

While you are silenced, you cannot cast spells, read scrolls or use divine
invocations. The same is true for any monster within the effect radius. The
field of silence (recognizable by <tiles>the special-looking frame tiles</tiles>
<console>different-coloured floor squares</console>) is always centered on you
and will move along with you. The radius will gradually shrink, eventually
making you the only one affected, before the effect fades entirely.
%%%%
HINT_AUTOPICKUP_THROWN

When stepping on items you've thrown, they will be picked up automatically.
%%%%
HINT_GAINED_SPELLCASTING

As your Spellcasting skill increases, you will be able to memorise more spells,
and will suffer somewhat fewer failures when you cast them.

HINT_CLOUD_WARNING

Rather than step into this cloud and hurt yourself, you should either wait for a

<tiles> or click on your avatar with the <w>right mouse button</w></tiles>.
%%%%
HINT_MAGICAL_STAFF_WITH_TROG

Seeing how Trog frowns upon the use of magic, this staff will be of little use
to you and you might just as well <w>$cmd[CMD_DROP]</w>rop it now.
%%%%
HINT_DESCRIBE_MISCELLANEOUS_ITEM

Miscellaneous items sometimes harbour magical powers that can be harnessed by
evoking the item with <w>$cmd[CMD_EVOKE]</w>.

statues often mark special areas, dangerous ones or ones harbouring treasure.
%%%%
HINT_DESCRIBE_TRAP_PLATE

able to avoid tripping traps by flying over them; their magic construction will
cause them to be triggered anyway.
%%%%
HINT_DESCRIBE_TRAP_SHAFT

The dungeon contains a number of natural obstacles such as shafts, which lead
one to three levels down. Once you know the shaft is there, you can safely step
over it.\nIf you want to jump down there, use <w>$cmd[CMD_GO_DOWNSTAIRS]</w> to
do so. Be warned that getting back here might be difficult.

%%%%
HINT_DESCRIBE_UPSTAIRS

You can enter the previous (shallower) level by following these up
(<w>$cmd[CMD_GO_UPSTAIRS]</w>). This is ideal for retreating or finding a safe
resting spot, since the previous level will have less monsters, and monsters on
this level can't follow you up unless they're standing right next to you. To
get back to this level again, press <w>$cmd[CMD_GO_DOWNSTAIRS]</w> while
standing on the downstairs.<tiles> In Tiles, you can perform either action
simply by clicking the <w>left mouse button</w> instead.</tiles>

(<w>$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_MAP]</w>) with
<w>$cmd[CMD_MAP_EXCLUDE_AREA]$cmd[CMD_MAP_EXCLUDE_AREA]</w> while your cursor
is on the square in question. Such an exclusion will prevent autotravel from
ever entering that grid until you remove the exclusion with another press of
<w>$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_MAP]$cmd[CMD_MAP_EXCLUDE_AREA]</w>.
%%%%
HINT_DESCRIBE_ALTAR_ATHEIST

followers, bestowing powers of all sorts upon them, but many of them demand a
life of dedication, constant tributes or entertainment in return.

HINT_DESCRIBE_FADED_ALTAR_ATHEIST

This particular altar is so ancient that you cannot make out which god it is
dedicated to! Converting here by pressing <w>$cmd[CMD_GO_DOWNSTAIRS]</w> while

grant you some additional piety in thanks.

HINT_DESCRIBE_NONFADED_ALTAR_ATHEIST

You can get information about <w>$1</w> by pressing

HINT_DESCRIBE_FADED_ALTAR

This particular altar is so ancient that you cannot make out which god it is
dedicated to, and $1 probably won't like it if you switch allegiance. If you
want to take the risk, you can convert here by pressing

you into service of a random god, who will grant you some additional piety in
thanks.

$1 probably won't like it if you switch allegiance, but having a look won't
hurt: to get information on <w>$2</w>, press <w>$cmd[CMD_GO_DOWNSTAIRS]</w>
while standing on the altar. Before taking up the responding faith (and
abandoning your current one!) you'll be asked for confirmation.\nTo see your
current standing with $1 press <w>$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_RELIGION]</w>
<tiles>, or click with your <w>right mouse button</w> on your avatar while
pressing <w>Shift</w></tiles>.
