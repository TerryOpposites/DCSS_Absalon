Juan Barbosa Notes:
RAFDONIA / SHOPS:
    - Support for custom shops like I wanted seem to be straightforward to implement. Related files.
    Related Files for custom shops
        shop-type.h
        shopping.h
        shopping.cc
        god-abil.cc (because of GOZAG God apparently, so its just for compatibility)
    
    files for drawing custom shops
        dgn-overview.cc
        dungeon.cc
        tilepick.cc
    
    - Need to look into summon code or Beogh code for creating followers that do no despawn.

ESSENCES:
    - Essences can be implemented as mutations, all relevant files are explained in mutation_creation.txt
    - May need to expand mutation code support stats and abilities, I don't exactly know by how much yet.
    - Support for the monster dropping an essence should be done in mon-death.cc
    - Need to read monster_creation.txt to learn how to create monsters for the game and learn about relevant files regarding monsters for supporting an essence,
    util/mon-gen.py generates all the monster data for the game, careful study of this must be done to configure which essence goes with which monster.

XP:
    - mon-death.cc has code for giving player experience, function _give_player_experience seems to be the proper place to check for whether a monster was defeated 
    or not by the player and award experience. player.cc gain_exp or close by would need to be modified to set the amount of xp needed to level

TIME:
    - Game tracks player time already, I need to expand this feature so that Labyrinth time is tracked when inside the labyrinth and rafdonia time is tracked separately
    - main.cc, method world_reacts is probably a good place to check the amount of time passed to kick out player from labyrinth
    need to figure out how time is drawn on the screen to properly represent time passed to the player

DUNGEON:
    - Need to create spawn points that refresh every few hours when the player is not around.
    - Need to look into how HUGE (50k tiles by 50k tiles) can affect the game, game seems to support bigger rooms just fine like mines or lair
    - Need to look into removing all item drops from inside the dungeon, there should be no scrolls, gold, potions, weapons, armor, etc. Only thing that
    should be supported are mana stones upon defeat.
